circle embracing his lriend Laelius, L. Furius Philus, Scaevola
(the augur), Fannius, and the poeta Lucilius and Terence.
Rumor had it that he assisled Temnos in the composition oi
his comedies.

To Laelius, Scipio was attached by ties of the closest friend-
ship. At home and io the field the two were inseparable.
Cicero in the Republic (1, 18) telle us that Laelius reverenced
Scipio aa divine iu consequence of his military procrees, while
Scipio in turn regarded Laelius as aiather. Their vicus of life

and government were identical; even the observatione on friend·
ship which Cicero iu this dialogus puts iu the mouth oi Laelius
are expressly declared by the latter to be those of his friend.
Politically Scipio was a firm aristocrat. He had been ah
seut iu Spain at the time of the disturbances which culminated
in the murder oi Tiberius Gracchus, but on his return he spolie
out holdly and, though married to Sempronia, the sister oi ’

Gracchus, did not hesitate to declare his belief that the agitator
had been justly slain. This was in 133 ac, and ior the four
remaining years oi his lile Scipio was the recognized leader of
the aristocratic party. One morning in 1⁴29 ac. he was found
dead in his hed. Whether he was the victim of violence or died
a natural death was never known. Suspiciou pointed to foul
play at the hands oi his political opponente. Rumor linlred
itseli especially with the names oi Fuluiae, Carbo, and the
younger Gracchus. Oi these, Carbo was the most generally

suspected, and is even expressly mentioned by Cicero as the
author oi the dead.
