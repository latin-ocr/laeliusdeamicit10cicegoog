sation naturally turns 55 Laelius's intimate friendsbip with
Scipio, and this in turn leads 55 555 subject 51 friendship in
general, on which, at the request 51 555 young men, Laelius
sets forth bis views at length.

(5) Laelius. Gaius Laelius was born shortly before 185 rac.
In 155 55. 515 interest 15 philosophy was first roused by listen-
ing to the teaohings 51 three Greek philosophans-Diogenes,
Critolaus, and Carneades-who, having come to Rome on a
diplomatic errand, ventured to 555 forth 55 Roman youth the
’ 555555 51 55515 several schools. It was Stoicism which appealed
most strongly to Laelius, and he subsequently pursued his
studies in this field under Panaetius 51 Rhodes, the most impor-
tant representative 51 555 Stoic school at that time. Entering
public life, 55 was tribune of the plebs in 151 rac, served in
the Third Punic War, and was present 55555 1511 51 Carthago
in 146 nc. 3 the year following he was elected praetor. In this
capacity he took the field and successfully conducted the Lusita·
5155 campaign against Viriathus. The same year he was 555555
augur, and took a prominent part 15 opposing the movement to
change the existing method of electing the members of the au·
gural college. Hitherto vacanoies arising in this board had been
filled by the augurs themselves. The tribune Crassus proposed
55 transfer the electiori to the people‚ but his plans were defeated

¹by Laelius (555 5 96 51 555 (15 Amicitia). Fonr years later Ἰ

(141 ne.) Laelius was defeated as candidate for the consulship,
but was successful the year afterward.

In 515 general character Laelius combined Greek ideality, love
⁸ of literature and philosophy on the one hand, with Roman com-
mon-sense and wisdom in practioal affairs on 555 other. The
surname Sapiens given him by his contemporaries was probably
intended to recognize both these sides of his character. Person-
ally 55 was mild 51 manner, 5555-55555551, and thoroughly
optimistic. For 515 relations with Scipio, see 55155, ς 5.

(5) Scaevola. Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the augur, was son·
· in-law of Laelius. The dates 51 515 birth and death are unknown,
