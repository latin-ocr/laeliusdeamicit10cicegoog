PREFACE

—oot—

Fon the text of this edition, Ι have endeavcrcd to
utilize the critical material that has appeared since the
publication of Mdller's edition (Leipsic5 1879). In the
commentary the aim has been to give only such infor-
mation as the student needs for an adequate under-
standing of the text. All discussion of moot points
whether of text or interpretation, has been relegated
toa Critical Appendix.

In the preparation of the notes I have been espe-
cially aided by the excellent commentarios of Reid,
Strelitz‚ and Meissner.

Το Professor Pcase, Professor Alfred Gudeman, of
the University of Pennsylvania, Professor H. Ο. Elmer,
and Mr. Chae. L. Durham, of Cornell University‚ Ι
wish also to extend acknowledgment for valuable
assistance and advice.

Irasci, December 1, 1897.
